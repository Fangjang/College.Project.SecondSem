###2nd Semester College Project
This is my 2nd Semester College project. It is written in C++ and uses SFML library ver 2.5.1 32bit.
To build this project , you'll need include and libs files of SFMl 2.5.1 32bit which can downloaded as a zip from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/).
After downloading the zip, paste the contents of include and libs folder from the zip to the solution directories' include and lib folder.
